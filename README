Gaff is a small debugger framework I made to help me reverse
engineer Westwood Games' Blade Runner.

It has virtually only been tested with Blade Runner so don't
expect anything else to work.

The main feature I wanted from Gaff was to enable me to run
custom code on breakpoints. This has helped me with dumping
function arguments, tracing program flow, and dump graphics
frame buffers while the game was running.

Something I really don't expect to work: Programs that create
child processes. Gaff will probably be confused by that.

I share it in the hope that somebody else might find it useful.
And because digitall strong-armed me into releasing it...

I compile it with mingw g++. Enable C++11 support and link
with psapi. Proper build tools might be added if anybody wants
it.
